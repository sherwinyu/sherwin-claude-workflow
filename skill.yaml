      # Load Development Workflow

      Load the workflow configuration so you can start working on tickets immediately.

      ## Step 1: Load Core Files

      Read the main orchestrator file from the workflow directory in this project.
      Look for it at common locations:
      - `workflow/CLAUDE.md`
      - `.claude/workflow/CLAUDE.md`
      - `packages/client/src/modules/*/workflow/CLAUDE.md`

      This is the **single source of truth** for the workflow.

      ## Step 2: Load Knowledge Files (if they exist)

      Also read these files if present:
      - `workflow/knowledge/patterns.md`
      - `workflow/knowledge/edge-cases.md`

      ## Step 3: Ready Message

      After reading, present to user:

      ```markdown
      ## Development Workflow Loaded

      **Linear Project:** [PROJECT_NAME]
      **Team:** [TEAM_NAME]
      **Lint:** [LINT_COMMAND]

      **Ready to work!** Try:
      - "Pick up ticket TEAM-123 and run the workflow"
      - "List open tickets"
      - "Create a ticket for [description]"

      **Agents available:**
      - Context Agent - Codebase exploration
      - Dev Agent - Implementation
      - QA Agent - Browser automation

      **Knowledge loaded:**
      - patterns.md: [X patterns documented]
      - edge-cases.md: [Y edge cases documented]
      ```

      ## Quick Load

      This command should complete quickly without asking questions. Just:
      1. Read the workflow files
      2. Report what was loaded
      3. Be ready for ticket commands
